# SVM model

The SVM (Support Vector Machine) model is a supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks, aiming to find the hyperplane that best separates different classes in a dataset. In your application, it is located in the models/model.p file, likely as a serialized model ready for predictions.

# Yolov8 model

The YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once version 8) model is a state-of-the-art deep learning algorithm used for real-time object detection, capable of detecting and classifying objects in images and videos. In your application, it is stored in the models/best.pt file, likely as a trained PyTorch model ready for inference.
